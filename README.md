My first ever game (2D, using SFML) in C++ TODO: Remove all the VisualStudio files (sln, vcxproj...), use CMake.

There is a need to download and install SFML to run the code. SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is easier to use than lower-level libraries like SDL or OpenGL and is cross-platrorm. SFML official site: http://www.sfml-dev.org https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/3.0/getting-started/visual-studio/ I downloaded SFML 2.6.2, did the 'SFML and Visual Studio' installation version, used Visual Studio 2017 and configured x64 Release. Check these paths in Visual Studio in this installation tutorial if match your SFML folders. See 'TODO' above.
